# Exercise6 Cadastral Data
# In the file cadastral_data.csv is contained the cadastral information of the towns: "Ogdenville", "North Haverbrook", "Shelbyville", "Springfield". The data has been manually entered by municipal employees of the cities, from the old paper archives. Now with the system successfully digitized, you are asked to perform some analytics, load the file cadastral_data.csv and:
# Is there any problem in the dataset? can you fix it?
# How many square meter, are dedicated in each town to shops?
# What is the mean size of house for each province and town
# Create a csv, containing the ratio of number of houses to number of garages for each city, sorted in. ascending order
