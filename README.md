## ðŸ“š Assignment

**Crop Disease Prediction and Alert System**

Design and prototype a big data system for real-time detection and prediction of crop diseases. Aggregate data from on-field IoT sensors (temperature, humidity, soil pH), drone imagery, and local weather information. Use machine learning in (or on top of) Spark or Flink to detect anomalies indicative of pests or diseases. Generate early warnings for farmers and suggest targeted interventions (pesticide usage, irrigation adjustments). Integrate a dashboard that visually maps high-risk areas, improving food security and reducing crop losses.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This system:
- Ingests data from IoT sensors and weather APIs  
- Streams the data through Kafka topics  
- Consumes and stores the data in PostgreSQL  
- Can apply anomaly detection (future)  
- Will expose alerts and visualization (future dashboard)
